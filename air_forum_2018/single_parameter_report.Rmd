## Report for Abilene Christian University for the `r params$year` year

Abilene Christian University has `r prettyNum(sum(enrollment$num_enrolled), big.mark = ",")` students enrolled. In `r params$year`, `r prettyNum(admissions$applicants_total, big.mark = ",")` prospective undergraduate students applied to the university. Of those students, `r prettyNum(admissions$admissions_total, big.mark = ",")` (`r round(admissions$admissions_total/admissions$applicants_total*100, digits=0)` percent) were admitted. It cost \$`r prettyNum(tuition$state_tuition, big.mark = ",")` in `r params$year` for in-state and \$`r prettyNum(tuition$oos_tuition, big.mark = ",")` for out-of-state students.

For students admitted in `r params$year`, SAT scores for the 25th and 75th percentile were `r sat$sat_cr_25` and `r sat$sat_cr_75` on critical reading and `r sat$sat_math_25` and `r sat$sat_math_75` on math.
